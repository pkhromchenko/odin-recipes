        <p>Moonshine is high-proof liquor that is produced illegally.[1] The name was derived from a tradition of creating the
        alcohol during the nighttime, thereby avoiding detection.
        
        In recent years commercial producers increasingly label some of their products as "moonshine".[2]</p>

    <div class="description-paragraph-container">
        <p>Moonshine historically referred to "clear, unaged whiskey",[28] once made with barley in Scotland and Ireland or corn
        mash in the United States,[29] though sugar became just as common in illicit liquor during the last century. The word
        originated in the British Isles as a result of excise laws, but only became meaningful in the United States after a tax
        passed during the Civil War outlawing non-registered stills. Illegal distilling accelerated during the Prohibition era
        (1920-1933) which mandated a total ban on alcohol production under the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Since
        the amendment's repeal in 1933, laws focus on evasion of taxation on any type of spirits or intoxicating liquors.
        Applicable laws were historically enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives of the US
        Department of Justice, but are now usually handled by state agencies. Enforcement agents were once known colloquially as
        "revenuers".</p>
        <p>The earliest known instance of the term "moonshine" being used to refer to illicit alcohol dates to the 1785 edition of
        Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, which was published in England. Prior to that, "moonshine" referred to anything
        "illusory" or to literally the light of the moon.[30] The U.S. Government considers the word a "fanciful term" and does
        not regulate its use on the labels of commercial products, as such, legal moonshines may be any type of spirit, which
        must be indicated elsewhere on the label.[31]</p>
