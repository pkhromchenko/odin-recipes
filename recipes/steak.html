        <p>A steak, also sometimes called "beef steak", is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including
        a bone. It is normally grilled, though it can also be pan-fried. Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and
        kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.</p>

        <p>Besides cattle, steaks are also often cut from other animals, including bison, camel, goat, horse, kangaroo,[1][2]
        sheep, ostrich, pigs, reindeer, turkey, deer, and zebu, as well as various types of fish, especially salmon and large
        fish such as swordfish, shark, and marlin. For some meats, such as pork, lamb and mutton, chevon, and veal, these cuts
        are often referred to as chops. Some cured meat, such as gammon, is commonly served as steak.</p>
        <p>Grilled portobello mushroom may be called mushroom steak, and similarly for other vegetarian dishes.[3] Imitation steak
        is a food product that is formed into a steak shape from various pieces of meat. Grilled fruits such as watermelon have
        been used as vegetarian steak alternatives.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 pound) butcher's steak (hanger steak)</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon clarified butter</li>
            <li>â…” cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove all silver skin and extra fat from the steak. Carefully cut out the connective tissue that connects the 2 halves
            of the steak, separating the whole into 2 long pieces. Cut lobe of meat from one half (it's a piece that is slightly
            separated from the larger half). Then cut each of the 2 larger halves into 2 steaks each. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat skillet over high heat. Add clarified butter when pan is hot, then place the steaks in the pan. Reduce heat to
            medium. Cook until browned on all sides, firm, and reddish-pink on the inside. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
            the center should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), a total of about 12 minutes. (This cut of meat has a sort of
            triangular shape, so about 4 minutes per side.) Transfer to a warm plate and tent with foil to let steaks rest and allow
            temperature to rise to 130 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Pour stock into skillet set over medium heat. Stir with a wooden spoon scraping up the browned bits from the bottom.
            When brownings dissolve and liquid begins to reduce after 2 or 3 minutes, reduce heat to low. Add accumulated juices
            from the meat, balsamic vinegar, and butter chunks. Cook and stir until butter melts. If liquid has reduced too much,
            add a splash of broth. Taste to check if sauce needs a bit of salt.</li>
            <li>To serve, slice steaks and spoon pan sauce over them.</li>
        </ol>
