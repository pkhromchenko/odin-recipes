        <p>A pork chop, like other meat chops, is a loin cut taken perpendicular to the spine of the pig and is usually a rib or part of a vertebra. Pork chops are unprocessed and leaner than other cuts.[1] Chops are commonly served as an individual portion, and can be accompanied with applesauce, vegetables, and other sides. Pork is one of the most commonly consumed meats in the world.[1][2] In the United States, pork chops are the most commonly consumed meat cut from the pork loin and account for 10% of total pork consumption.[2][3][4] It comes from the pork shoulder.[5]</p>
        <p>The center cut or pork loin chop includes a large T-shaped bone and is structurally similar to the beef T-bone steak.[6] Rib chops come from the rib portion of the loin, and are similar to rib eye steaks. Blade or shoulder chops come from the spine and tend to contain much connective tissue. The sirloin chop is taken from the (rear) leg end and also contains much connective tissue. The shoulder end produces chops that are considerably fattier than the chops taken from the loin end.[1]</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (6 ounce) thin-cut bone-in pork chops</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season both sides of the pork chops with cayenne pepper and black pepper and lightly poke with a fork to make a few
            holes. Place pork in a casserole dish, pour soy sauce over top, and add garlic. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and
            marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour, turning halfway through.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove chops from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Place chops on the preheated grill and reduce heat to medium. Cook until no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes
            per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
